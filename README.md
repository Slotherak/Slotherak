- 👋 Hi, I’m @Slotherak. And I'm in Systems and Security, with encryption and decryption as my main focus.
- 👀 I’m interested in video games, modding said games, and anything that breaks my mind, from illusions to recursion to meta-references in code. 
     Puzzle obsessed and proficient.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning GP Blocks for the RWaC startup.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate, and am open to negotiations on how. Have access to internet sporadically, so availability is up in the air.
- 📫 How to reach me: my email is Slotherak@gmail.com, and if you really need to reach me quickly, put the phrase "I don't care about sloths!" 
     in the topic field. My email will(should) filter it into the "urgent" list.
