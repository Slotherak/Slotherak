- 👋 Hi, I’m @Slotherak. And I'm in Systems and Security, with encryption and decryption as my main focus. I intend to improve the Enigma code somehow and push the true limits of even quantum computing resources. Oh, you say computers run on mathematical principles? We'll see about that...
- 👀 I’m interested in video games, modding said games, and anything that breaks my mind, from illusions to recursion to meta-references in code. 
     Puzzle obsessed and proficient.
- 🌱 I’m currently freshening up on my old Java skills and Processing skills so I can help out with the RWaC initiative. Two years of quarantine has been heckin destructive on my memory... how did we go from Java 8 to Java 19 in just the span of two years?! I know that quarantine wouldn't interfere, but Java is ancient, how the heck did we more than double the version number? That would be like waking up and finding out that you needed to upgrade to Windows 24!
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate, and am open to negotiations on how. Have access to internet sporadically, so availability is up in the air. Time of day that I'm usually awake and aware is about 4 PM eastern time, to about 3 AM eastern time. Outside of that time range I will probably not respond. Sleep is a luxury for me, and yet without it I can't function at all.
- 📫 How to reach me: my email is Slotherak@gmail.com, and if you really need to reach me quickly, put the phrase "I don't care about sloths!" 
     in the topic field. My email will(should) filter it into the "urgent" list.
